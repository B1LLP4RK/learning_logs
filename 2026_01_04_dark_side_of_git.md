# Dark Side of Git

This is one of the first articles about things I learn

## Intro

I have been using git for quite a few years, worked in small group projects, but I somehow survived with the bare minimum knowledge.

There are many sources to learn git.
Youtube videos, articles, and so on, but recently I have been revising my knowledge with the Pro Git, which is the pdf version.

I believe there are many ways to learn, but for git, I believe this book is one of the best for the following reasons.

- the book is open source, contributed by people
  - means it is up to date all the time
  - cross-checked by numerouse people
  - FREE

The book is available for download in official git website.

## Things to note

- I skimmed parts that are for command's nitty gritties

### Git does not store the 'diff's between commits

This was surprising because the first time I was learning git, the Youtube tutorial said it uses diff.

Git only stores the full complete versions of each file when we stage it. The differences generated when we use `git show` is generated by git intelligently computing the difference between the two complete files.

When we stage a file with `git add something.txt`, git creates a snapshot and that is referred to the so called 'tree's which i'll explain later.

### How branching/switching works

How branching works internally is a internal issue of git that nobody has to know, but knowing it finally helped me understand what 'HEAD' is.

In git, Commits are objects. Like in OOP.
Commits have parents and children, which are other commit objects.
Any branch like 'main', or any created branches, are just a 'pointer' to commits.

Essentially, creating another branch with 'git branch newBranch'  is just creating another object called `newBranch`.

Now 'HEAD', is just a pointer to the pointer haha.

So head pointing to 'main', means you are currently in main branch. Any commit you do will be to `main`.

Then `git switch newBranch` or `git checkout newBranch` will make 'HEAD' point to `newBranch`.

Until now, I was confused what 'HEAD' is whenever I see it in git outputs, wondering 'if it is a tag that is automatically created'?

And 'detached HEAD' that I sometimes see when I checkout an old commit is simply indicating a state where the 'HEAD' object is not pointing to anything(my guess).
I mean, just think of 'attached HEAD' as a state where `HEAD` is properly pointing to a 'branch', and detached means its not pointing to anything.

For those who read this, I wish you a great 2026.
Happy new year!
